# Let's add some 
```{python}
species = "Chinstrap"

```{python}
#| label: data_import
import pandas as pd
from itables import show
penguins_df = pd.read_csv("penguins_df.csv")

filtered_df = penguins_df[penguins_df['species']== species]

show(filtered_df)
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: plot
# Quarto remember what was in previous code cells
# Hash pipe (#|) option can modify behaviour of code cell
# for example
# #| echo: false hide the text
# #| label: label_name labels the call

You can blend `python` and `R` into the same Quarto workbook.  Quarto will even try to inteligently allow one language's variable into the other.

```{python}
#| label: set-my-number
my_number = 15
```

The number you chose is `{python} my_number`

The average weight of a penguin is `{python} penguins_df['body_mass_g'].mean()`
